Circle.java

* In the function scale() the variable radius should be 
multiplied by the variable factor. Originally the function was 
written so that radius and factor were added together instead of
multiplied. The test simpleScale() caught this error.

Circle1.java:

* The intersects() function doesn't properly compare the absolute 
values of the center coordinates and the radius. It originally
used the less than comparator (<) but it should use the less than
or equal to comparator (<=). My test called simpleIntersects()
caught this error.

Circle2.java:

* In the constructor for Circle2 the x and y coordinate variables were in the wrong order. Originally the function read:
	super(y,x,radius)
instead of:
	super(x,y,radius)
The tests simpleMove() and simpleNegMove() caught this error.

* The intersects() function followed the wrong logic to test if 
the two circle were intersecting. I could sort of follow the formula that was trying to be used. The correct equation is:
	(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2 <= (r1 + r2)^2
